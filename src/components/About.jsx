        An explorer of technology, science and nature; I love to continuously expand the frontier of my undertanding and
        to share knowledge and discoveries with others. Whilst completing my Masters of Physics Degree I developed an
        interest and understanding of the power of the web to share information and ideas. From that ground zero I have
        learned many computer science principles, languages and tools and am now creating beautiful websites. My focus
        has been on the Front-End building user interfaces, but I have also gained the skills required to develop
        Back-End servers systems.
