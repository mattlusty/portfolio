        An explorer of technology, science and nature - I seek to continuously expand the frontier of my understanding
        and to share discoveries with others. Whilst completing my Masters of Physics Degree I developed a keen interest
        in the awesome power of the web as a platform to create and share powerful resources with people across the
        world. Since day one, have learned many computer science principles, languages and tools and can now create
        beautiful websites that can provide any digital function that I can be imagined. My focus has been on the
        Front-End building user interfaces, but I have also gained the skills required to develop Back-End servers
        systems.
