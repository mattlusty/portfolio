        An explorer of technology, science and nature; I love to continuously expand the frontier of my understanding
        and to share knowledge and discoveries with others. Whilst completing my Masters of Physics Degree I developed a
        keen interest in the power of the web to creatively share information and ideas. From this ground zero point, I
        have learned numerous computer science principles, languages and tools and now creating beautiful functional
        websites. My focus has been on the Front-End building user interfaces, but I have also gained the skills
        required to develop Back-End servers systems.
